      As a client developer, you'll need some documentation about the API to get you started. Ideally, the
      documentation explains what the system is for and how to achieve certain goals as well as how the API works.
      We saw an example of HTML documentation for the RESTBucks API in <xref linked="restbucks-api-doc"/>.

      The documentation must be divided into a couple of different modules, with increasing levels of 
      completeness. These different modules should address different stages in the developer's learning cycle. The
      getting started guide should be as short as possible and contain links to actually get started. The reference 
      manual should be complete and thorough. And you probably want something in between that covers common ways of 
      using the API. We cover documentation in <xref linkend="documentation"/>.

      A client SDK for the API can make your life as a client developer a lot easier, as we discussed in
      <xref linkend="sdk"/>.
