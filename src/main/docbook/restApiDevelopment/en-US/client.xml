      As a client developer, you'll need some documentation about the API to get you started. Ideally, the
      documentation explains what the system is for and how to achieve certain goals as well as how the API works.
      We saw an example of HTML documentation for the RESTBucks API in <xref linked="restbucks-api-doc"/>.

      A client SDK for the API can make your life as a client developer a lot easier, as we discussed in
      <xref linkend="sdk"/>.
