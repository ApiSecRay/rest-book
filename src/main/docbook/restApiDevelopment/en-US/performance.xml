  <title>Performance and Scalability</title>
  <para>
    Performance and scalability are two different but related qualities (see 
    <xref linkend="non-functional-requirements"/>). <firstterm>Performance</firstterm> is the amount of useful work
    accomplished in a some period of time. <firstterm>Scalability</firstterm> is the ability to handle a growing amount 
    of work over time. Performance is about how long a single activity takes; scalability is about how long an
    activity takes as more and more work is performed by the system.

    As we saw before, scalability is one of the raisons d'etre of REST. This chapter delves into the things you can
    do to ensure good performance and scalability.
