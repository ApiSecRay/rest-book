# REST Book

An (incomplete) book on REST, along with example source code. This book is about "pure" REST, as opposed to the widespread "pragmatic" REST, meaning it adheres to the original [definition](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm) provided by Roy Fielding, who coined the term.


# Creating the book from source

The book is built using the [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) build system. To run the build, simply type `gradlew`.
