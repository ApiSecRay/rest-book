# rest-book

A book on REST, along with example source code.


# Creating the book from source

The book is built using the [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) build system. To run the build, simply type `gradlew`.

The build currently requires that [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) be on the path to convert SVG files to PNG. 
We'll remove that dependency soon.
